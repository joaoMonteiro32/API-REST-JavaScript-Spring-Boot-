It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.

Depending on the XSLT processor being used this could allow arbitrary code to be executed when XMLUnit is used to transform data with a stylesheet who's source can not be trusted. If the stylesheet can be provided externally this may even lead to a remote code execution.\n\n## Patches\nUsers are advised to upgrade to XMLUnit for Java 2.10.0 where the default has been changed by means of https://github.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/commit/b81d48b71dfd2868bdfc30a3e17ff973f32bc15b\n\n### Workarounds\nXMLUnit's main use-case is performing tests on code that generates or processes XML. Most users will not use it to perform arbitrary XSLT transformations.\n\nUsers running XSLT transformations with untrusted stylesheets should explicitly use XMLUnit's APIs to pass in a pre-configured TraX `TransformerFactory` with extension functions disabled via features and attributes. The required `setFactory` or `setTransformerFactory` methods have been available since XMLUnit for Java 2.0.0.\n\n### References\n[Bug Report](https://github.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/264)\n[JAXP Security Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-E345AA09-801E-4B95-B83D-7F0C452538AA)\n",

The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b",

The second call attempts to remove the\n\"hash_list\" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first\ncall.\n\nFix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume\nmethods of the table's targets.\n\nIf a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.\nWe can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to\nreturn errors. We can't return success, because then the \"resume\" and\n\"postsuspend\" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the\nDMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace\ntools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nCPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n<snip>\nRSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\nRBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001\nR13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0\nFS:  00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? die+0x2d/0x80\n ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot]\n dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod]\n dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod]\n dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod]\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod]\n dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod]\n __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170\n do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e\nRIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead\n<snip>\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",

The description of cve is:\n\n  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux\n  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on\n  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing\n  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`\n  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or\n  potential code execution.\n\nIn aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial\ncode is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in\nlater tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the\ndev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb\ninitial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into\nuse-after-free because the net_device is freed.\n\nThis patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in\naoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",

But that led\nto a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also\ncalled from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,\nwhich was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (\"scsi: core: Fix a procfs host\ndirectory removal regression\"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call\nfrom dev_release().\n\nBut it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),\nand that function \"pairs\" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while\nscsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the\nreason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover\ncases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to\nscsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some\nerror paths, for example.\n\nSyzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on\nusb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see\nthat the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host\nallocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads\nto messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc\nstructure):\n\nusb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected\nproc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376\n\nThe proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),\nbut guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a\ncomment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is\nmeant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to\n{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.\n\nThis is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage\ndoes not trigger the warning anymore.",

                "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/vma: Fix UAF on destroy against retire race\n\nObject debugging tools were sporadically reporting illegal attempts to\nfree a still active i915 VMA object when parking a GT believed to be idle.\n\n[161.359441] ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: ffff88811643b958 object type: i915_active hint: __i915_vma_active+0x0/0x50 [i915]\n[161.360082] WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 276 at lib/debugobjects.c:514 debug_print_object+0x80/0xb0\n...\n[161.360304] CPU: 5 PID: 276 Comm: kworker/5:2 Not tainted 6.5.0-rc1-CI_DRM_13375-g003f860e5577+ #1\n[161.360314] Hardware name: Intel Corporation Rocket Lake Client Platform/RocketLake S UDIMM 6L RVP, BIOS RKLSFWI1.R00.3173.A03.2204210138 04/21/2022\n[161.360322] Workqueue: i915-unordered __intel_wakeref_put_work [i915]\n[161.360592] RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x80/0xb0\n...\n[161.361347] debug_object_free+0xeb/0x110\n[161.361362] i915_active_fini+0x14/0x130 [i915]\n[161.361866] release_references+0xfe/0x1f0 [i915]\n[161.362543] i915_vma_parked+0x1db/0x380 [i915]\n[161.363129] __gt_park+0x121/0x230 [i915]\n[161.363515] ____intel_wakeref_put_last+0x1f/0x70 [i915]\n\nThat has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is\ndeactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's\nactive counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation\nof the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.\n\nWe could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with\n__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from\nbeing used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of\n__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent\ni915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should\nrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.\n\nSince __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the\nGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long\nenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released\nand the GT parked.\n\nI believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (\"drm/i915:\nRemove the vma refcount\") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from\na dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,\nto i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.\nHowever, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a\nbug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9\n(\"drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation\").\n\nA VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.\nInstead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active\nintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that\nintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the\nVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.\n\nFix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,\nand putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,\nexclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes\nidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use\nasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,\ntake care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.\n\nv7: Add inline comments with justifications for:\n    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),\n    - using async variant of _put(),\n    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,\n    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.\nv6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing\n    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and\n    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of\n    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().\nv5: Replace \"tile\" with \"GT\" across commit description (Rodrigo),\n  - \n---truncated---",

Since there are two\nflaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.\n\nThe first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I think\nboth fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nSyzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file data\nto a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.\n\nThere are two flaws involved in this issue.\n\nThe first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using\nbtree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routine\nnilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadata\ncorruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causes\nnilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,\ncausing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.\n\nThe second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in\nthis inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()\nor others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,\nresulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()\nfailing.\n\nThis fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL\nwhen a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the\nconflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,\ncode -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during the\nblock lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error and\nconverted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.",

Gifting a reference to the\nassociated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed\nvCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded\nbefore the callback completes.\n\nDrop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from\nasync_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will\nresult in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()\nfinishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes:\n\n WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 251 at virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1435 kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320 [kvm]\n Modules linked in: vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap kvm_intel kvm irqbypass\n CPU: 8 PID: 251 Comm: kworker/8:1 Tainted: G        W          6.6.0-rc1-e7af8d17224a-x86/gmem-vm #119\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\n Workqueue: events async_pf_execute [kvm]\n RIP: 0010:kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320 [kvm]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  async_pf_execute+0x198/0x260 [kvm]\n  process_one_work+0x145/0x2d0\n  worker_thread+0x27e/0x3a0\n  kthread+0xba/0xe0\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n  </TASK>\n ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n INFO: task kworker/8:1:251 blocked for more than 120 seconds.\n       Tainted: G        W          6.6.0-rc1-e7af8d17224a-x86/gmem-vm #119\n \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n task:kworker/8:1     state:D stack:0     pid:251   ppid:2      flags:0x00004000\n Workqueue: events async_pf_execute [kvm]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  __schedule+0x33f/0xa40\n  schedule+0x53/0xc0\n  schedule_timeout+0x12a/0x140\n  __wait_for_common+0x8d/0x1d0\n  __flush_work.isra.0+0x19f/0x2c0\n  kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue+0x129/0x190 [kvm]\n  kvm_arch_destroy_vm+0x78/0x1b0 [kvm]\n  kvm_put_kvm+0x1c1/0x320 [kvm]\n  async_pf_execute+0x198/0x260 [kvm]\n  process_one_work+0x145/0x2d0\n  worker_thread+0x27e/0x3a0\n  kthread+0xba/0xe0\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n  </TASK>\n\nIf kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,\nthen there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all\ninvocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the\nvCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module\nunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference\nuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the\nlast reference to the KVM module.\n\nNote that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off\nthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the\nwork will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting\non the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the\nwork to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very\nsmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a\nnew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the\nremaining work is really just:\n\n        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);\n\n        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);\n\n        mmput(mm);\n\nand mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is\nstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.\n\nAdd a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\"\nwork items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a\nworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes\n__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).\n\nNote, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent module exit until al\n---truncated---",

The problem is that\nxas_pause() advances the loop counter - thereby skipping that page.\n\nWhat needs to happen is for xas_reset() to be called any time we decide we\ndon't want to process the page we're looking at, but rather send the\nrequest we are building and start a new one.\n\nFix this by copying and adapting the netfslib writepages code as a\ntemporary measure, with cifs writeback intending to be offloaded to\nnetfslib in the near future.\n\nThis also fixes the issue with the use of filemap_get_folios_tag() causing\nretry of a bunch of pages which the extender already dealt with.\n\nThis can be tested by creating, say, a 64K file somewhere not on cifs\n(otherwise copy-offload may get underfoot), mounting a cifs share with a\nwsize of 64000, copying the file to it and then comparing the original file\nand the copy:\n\n        dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/64K bs=64k count=1\n        mount //192.168.6.1/test /mnt -o user=...,pass=...,wsize=64000\n        cp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K\n        cmp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K\n\nWithout the fix, the cmp fails at position 64000 (or shortly thereafter).",

                "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix race when detecting delalloc ranges during fiemap\n\nFor fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the\nwhole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a\nscenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of\nthe same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but\nit may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).\n\nThis however introduced a race that makes us miss delalloc ranges for\nfile regions that are currently holes, so the caller of fiemap will not\nbe aware that there's data for some file regions. This can be quite\nserious for some use cases - for example in coreutils versions before 9.0,\nthe cp program used fiemap to detect holes and data in the source file,\ncopying only regions with data (extents or delalloc) from the source file\nto the destination file in order to preserve holes (see the documentation\nfor its --sparse command line option). This means that if cp was used\nwith a source file that had delalloc in a hole, the destination file could\nend up without that data, which is effectively a data loss issue, if it\nhappened to hit the race described below.\n\nThe race happens like this:\n\n1) Fiemap is called, without the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC flag, for a file that\n   has delalloc in the file range [64M, 65M[, which is currently a hole;\n\n2) Fiemap locks the inode in shared mode, then starts iterating the\n   inode's subvolume tree searching for file extent items, without having\n   the whole fiemap target range locked in the inode's io tree - the\n   change introduced recently by commit b0ad381fa769 (\"btrfs: fix\n   deadlock with fiemap and extent locking\"). It only locks ranges in\n   the io tree when it finds a hole or prealloc extent since that\n   commit;\n\n3) Note that fiemap clones each leaf before using it, and this is to\n   avoid deadlocks when locking a file range in the inode's io tree and\n   the fiemap buffer is memory mapped to some file, because writing\n   to the page with btrfs_page_mkwrite() will wait on any ordered extent\n   for the page's range and the ordered extent needs to lock the range\n   and may need to modify the same leaf, therefore leading to a deadlock\n   on the leaf;\n\n4) While iterating the file extent items in the cloned leaf before\n   finding the hole in the range [64M, 65M[, the delalloc in that range\n   is flushed and its ordered extent completes - meaning the corresponding\n   file extent item is in the inode's subvolume tree, but not present in\n   the cloned leaf that fiemap is iterating over;\n\n5) When fiemap finds the hole in the [64M, 65M[ range by seeing the gap in\n   the cloned leaf (or a file extent item with disk_bytenr == 0 in case\n   the NO_HOLES feature is not enabled), it will lock that file range in\n   the inode's io tree and then search for delalloc by checking for the\n   EXTENT_DELALLOC bit in the io tree for that range and ordered extents\n   (with btrfs_find_delalloc_in_range()). But it finds nothing since the\n   delalloc in that range was already flushed and the ordered extent\n   completed and is gone - as a result fiemap will not report that there's\n   delalloc or an extent for the range [64M, 65M[, so user space will be\n   mislead into thinking that there's a hole in that range.\n\nThis could actually be sporadically triggered with test case generic/094\nfrom fstests, which reports a missing extent/delalloc range like this:\n\n  generic/094 2s ... - output mismatch (see /home/fdmanana/git/hub/xfstests/results//generic/094.out.bad)\n      --- tests/generic/094.out\t2020-06-10 19:29:03.830519425 +0100\n      +++ /home/fdmanana/git/hub/xfstests/results//generic/094.out.bad\t2024-02-28 11:00:00.381071525 +0000\n      @@ -1,3 +1,9 @@\n       QA output created by 094\n       fiemap run with sync\n       fiemap run without sync\n      +ERROR: couldn't find extent at 7\n      +map is 'HHDDHPPDPHPH'\n      +logical: [       5..       6] phys:\n---truncated---",

According to the UEFI spec,\nthis stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large but\nall asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the same\nstack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.\n\nIn mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader calls\nthe 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bit\nentry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocation\nof 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in\n64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be using\nthe decompressor's limited boot stack.\n\nDue to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, any\nstack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit\n\n  5c4feadb0011983b (\"x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code\")\n\nmoved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the boot\nstack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns will\ncorrupt the end of the .data section.\n\nWhile it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size of\nthe boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed mode\nsystems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.\n\nSo instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering from\nthe 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI boot\nservice call is made.",

With having more then 2^32 blocks\nresize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can be\nreproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitly\nturning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (the\nsize of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:\n\n  dev=/dev/<some_dev> # should be >= 16 GiB\n  mkdir -p /corruption\n  /sbin/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))\n  mount -t ext4 $dev /corruption\n\n  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 of=/corruption/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))\n  sha1sum /corruption/test\n  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  /corruption/test\n\n  /sbin/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))\n  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk\n  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n  sha1sum /corruption/test\n  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  /corruption/test\n\n2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks per\nblock group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a meta\nblock group.\n\nThe last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laid\nout across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physical\nblock 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of the\nmeta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the file\nsystem will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is\n2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, in\next4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of the\nfirst meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this by\nsubstracting the size of a whole block group from the point where the\nmeta block group would start. This must be considered when updating the\nbackup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout.

                "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/PM: Drain runtime-idle callbacks before driver removal\n\nA race condition between the .runtime_idle() callback and the .remove()\ncallback in the rtsx_pcr PCI driver leads to a kernel crash due to an\nunhandled page fault [1].\n\nThe problem is that rtsx_pci_runtime_idle() is not expected to be running\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() has been called, but the latter doesn't really\nguarantee that.  It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks\nwill not be running when it returns.\n\nHowever, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when\npm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM\nstatus of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without\nwaiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for\n.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it\narguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly\nprohibited).\n\nThus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs\nto protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after\npm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after\npm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it\nhas started earlier.]\n\nOne way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the\nruntime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from\nbeing invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should\nit be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in\npci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the\ndriver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which\nwill prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr\ndriver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks.",

When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has\nbeen set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,\nand as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is\nattached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop\nthen tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the\nlist.\n\nFix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:\n- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to\n  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,\n  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu\n- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make\n  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through\n  unregister_netdev)\n\nSince we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because\nsuch path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are\nusing the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why\nwe can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ab077dbe58b1ea5de0a3b2ca21f275a07af967d2.camel@egauge.net/",

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

                "description": "Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.",

                "description": "Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments running directly on affected hardware. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/",

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file.

Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3.

A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.",
