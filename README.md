This API contains some initial tests to understand some of the methods that would be needed for the final solution and to obtain a connection to the database (MySQL).
In the end, it was possible to read a JSON file and store the information in the database. 
Send an email to the Admin who had 48 hours to remove the vulnerabilities with the severity high or critical. 
Every time a new JSON is sent, it will check for high or critical vulnerabilities that have been detected for more than 48 hours.
